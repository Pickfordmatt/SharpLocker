# SharpLocker

SharpLocker helps get current user credentials by popping a fake Windows lock screen, all output is sent to Console which works perfect for Cobalt Strike.

## Works
* Single/Multiple Monitors
* Windows 10
* Main monitor needs to be 1080p otherwise the location of the elements are wrong

## In Progress
* Backwards compatibility for Win 7
* All resolution support
